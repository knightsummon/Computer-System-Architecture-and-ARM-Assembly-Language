# 2.8 ARM pseudo-instructions (ADR and LDR)



### The difference between LDR, MOV and pseudo-LDR instructions



------

#### The format of the Pseudo-LDR instruction is:

 LDR R0,=0x30008000; IF there is an ''='' means pseudo-instruction, constant 0x30008000 assigns to R0

– LDR R0,=loop; The memory address represented by the label loop assigned to R0

#### The LDR instruction is usually used for register indirect addressing:

LDR R0,[R1]; Use the value of R1 as the memory address, and take the content of the memory address -> R0

 LDR R0, loop; The content at the memory address represented by the label loop ->R0

### MOV is usually used to transfer data between registers

– MOV R0 , R1; Set the value of register R1 -> register R0
– MOV R0, #20; will immediate data 20-> register R0

Summary: ARM is a RISC structure and cannot directly manipulate memory data. It needs to move data between memory and registers through LDR/STD instructions.

## The usefulness of the LDR pseudo-instruction

Imagine a situation that there is , 0x30008000, 32-bit content you need to move it to register and your Operation system only has 32-bits, there lefts no room for you to add the operand.

Convert to LDR instruction + literal pool form
– LDR, R0,=0x30008000;  //current instruction running address=PC-8

How to work inside:

​    – LDR, R0, [PC , #offset ]
​    –…
​    – DCD 0x3008000 ##Define constant doublewords, 4 * 8 = 2 * 16

• Define a word storage unit in the memory, and store the 32bit address 0x30008000 in the storage unit, which is usually called a **literal pool**
• Calculate the offset between the storage unit and the **LDR** pseudo-instruction, that is, **use relative addressing**, and send this address value to the R0 register

## ADR Pseudo Instruction

Relative addressing, so that the code position is independent

```
ADR R0，_start
• …
• _start
b _start
```

ADR address = PC-8

offset=_start-(PC-8)

ADD R0, PC, #offset

## The Difference between LDR and ADR

Both are Pseudo codes.

LDR uses the absolute address and LDR is mainly used to operate peripheral registers. ADR uses the relative address and to generate the position-free Code.

ADR usage: **DLL (Dynamic Link Library)**, Make sure program can link it to register everywhere.
