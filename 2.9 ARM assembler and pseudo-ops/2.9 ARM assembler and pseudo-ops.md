# 2.9 ARM assembler and pseudo-ops



## Assembly language program format

**• Organize source files in units of sections（段）**
• Divided into **code segment** and **data segment**, the segments are independent of each other
• An ARM assembler requires at least one code segment, identified using the AREA pseudo-op
The start of a segment, the segment name and attributes.
• Use the pseudo-operation ENTRY to identify the first instruction executed by the program
• Use the pseudo-operation END to mark the end of the assembler
• label
• Notes

## Copy

```
LDR R0,=SRC   ; Load the address of SRC into R0
LDR R1,=DST   ; Load the address of DST into R1
MOV R2,#10    ; Set the loop counter to 10

LOOP:
LDR R3,[R0],#4 ; Load a word from the address stored in R0 (source) and increment R0 by 4 bytes
STR R3,[R1],#4 ; Store the word into the address stored in R1 (destination) and increment R1 by 4 bytes
SUBS R2,R2,#1 ; Decrement the loop counter
BNE LOOP      ; Branch back to LOOP if the loop counter is not zero

```

define two arrays: `SRC` and `DST`. These arrays are initialized with a sequence of values using the `DCD` directive, which stands for "Define Constant Doubleword".

In the line `SRC DCD 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0`, the `SRC` array is initialized with the values `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0`. Each value is a 32-bit doubleword (4 bytes).

Similarly, the line `DST DCD 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0` initializes the `DST` array with ten 0 values.

Therefore, after executing the copy operation, the `DST` array will contain the same values as the `SRC` array.

## Symbols and Labels

### Definition of symbols
• In ARM assembly, use symbols to represent addresses, variables and numeric constants
**• When a symbol is used to identify an address, it is also called a label**

### local label

#### features
• Address references by numbers [0,99] instead of using names (characters)
• scoped to the current segment
• Quotation format: **%{F|B|A|T} N{routname}**
     »F: instructs the compiler to search forward only
     »B: instructs the compiler to search only backwards
     »A: instructs the compiler to search all nesting levels of the macro
     » T : instructs the compiler to search the current level of the macro
     »routename: local label scope name, defined using ROUT
     »If B and F are not specified, the compiler will search backward first, and then search forward

## Pseudo Operation

• Some special instruction mnemonics in ARM assembly language
• The main purpose is to perform various processing on the assembly source program instructions and assemble them into a complete assembly program
• The pseudo-operation is for the assembler, similar to the macro in C language, it is for the compiler. After preprocessing, macros disappear; after assembly, pseudo-ops disappear.
• Different compilation environments may have different pseudo-operation formats.

### Commonly used pseudo-operations

• Symbol definition pseudo-ops: **GBLA, LCLA…**
• Data definition pseudo-operations: **DCD, DCB, SPACE**
• Assembler control pseudo-ops: **AREA, ENTRY, MACRO, MEND**
